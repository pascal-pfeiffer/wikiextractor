'''Modified Newtonian dynamics''' ('''MOND''') is a [[hypothesis]] that proposes a modification of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] to account for observed properties of [[galaxies]]. It is an alternative to the hypothesis of [[dark matter]] in terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently understood laws of physics.

Created in 1982 and first published in 1983 by Israeli physicist [[Mordehai Milgrom]],<ref name="Milgrom papers">{{Cite journal |last=Milgrom |first=M. |date=1983 |title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics as a possible alternative to the hidden mass hypothesis |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=270 |pages=365–370 |doi=10.1086/161130 |bibcode=1983ApJ...270..365M|doi-access=free }}. {{Cite journal |last=Milgrom |first=M. |date=1983 |title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics - Implications for galaxies |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=270 |pages=371–383 |doi=10.1086/161131 |bibcode=1983ApJ...270..371M}}. {{Cite journal |last=Milgrom |first=M. |date=1983 |title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics - Implications for galaxy systems |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=270 |pages= 384|doi= 10.1086/161132 |bibcode=1983ApJ...270..384M}}.</ref> the hypothesis' original motivation was to explain why the velocities of stars in galaxies were observed to be larger than expected based on Newtonian mechanics. Milgrom noted that this discrepancy could be resolved if the [[gravitational force]] experienced by a star in the outer regions of a galaxy was proportional to the ''square'' of its centripetal [[acceleration]] (as opposed to the centripetal acceleration itself, as in [[Newton's second law]]) or alternatively, if gravitational force came to vary inversely ''linearly'' with radius (as opposed to the [[inverse square]] of the radius, as in [[Newton's law of gravity]]). MOND departs from Newton's laws at extremely small accelerations that are characteristic of the outer regions of galaxies as well as the inter-galaxy forces within galaxy clusters, but which are far below anything encountered in the [[Solar System]] or on Earth.

MOND is an example of a class of theories known as [[modified models of gravity|modified gravity]], and is an alternative to the hypothesis that the dynamics of galaxies are determined by massive, invisible [[dark matter halo]]s. Since Milgrom's original proposal, proponents of MOND have claimed to successfully predict a variety of galactic phenomena that they state are difficult to understand as consequences of dark matter.<ref name="tale of two paradigms">{{Cite journal |last = McGaugh |first = S. |title = A Tale of Two Paradigms: the Mutual Incommensurability of LCDM and MOND |date=2015 |arxiv = 1404.7525 |bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..250M |doi = 10.1139/cjp-2014-0203 |volume=93 |issue = 2 |journal=Canadian Journal of Physics |pages=250–259| s2cid = 51822163 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kroupa, P. |author2=Pawlowski, M. |author3=Milgrom, M. |year=2012 |title=The failures of the standard model of cosmology require a new paradigm |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics |volume=21 |issue=14 |page= 1230003 |doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030|arxiv=1301.3907 |bibcode=2012IJMPD..1230003K |s2cid=118461811}}</ref>

Though MOND explains the anomalously great rotational velocities of galaxies at their perimeters, it does not fully explain the velocity dispersions of individual galaxies within galaxy clusters. MOND reduces the discrepancy between the velocity dispersions and clusters' observed missing baryonic mass from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2. However, the residual discrepancy cannot be accounted for by MOND, requiring that other explanations close the gap such as the presence of as-yet undetected missing baryonic matter.<ref name="Milgrom Scholarpedia">Mordehai, M.

Several independent observations point to the fact that the visible mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters is insufficient to account for their dynamics, when analyzed using Newton's laws. This discrepancy – known as the "missing mass problem" – was first identified for clusters by Swiss astronomer [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1933 (who studied the [[Coma cluster]]),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6 |pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |title=On the masses of nebulae and of clusters of nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864|doi-access=free }}</ref> and subsequently extended to include [[spiral galaxies]] by the 1939 work of [[Horace Babcock]] on [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=H. |year=1939 |title=The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula |journal=Lick Observatory Bulletin |volume=498 |number=498|page=41 |doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1939LicOB.19.41B |bibcode=1939LicOB..19...41B |doi-access=free }}</ref>

These early studies were augmented and brought to the attention of the astronomical community in the 1960s and 1970s by the work of [[Vera Rubin]] at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]] in Washington, who mapped in detail the rotation velocities of stars in a large sample of spirals. While Newton's Laws predict that stellar rotation velocities should decrease with distance from the galactic centre, Rubin and collaborators found instead that they remain almost constant<ref name="Rubin1970">{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Vera C. |author1-link=Vera Rubin |last2=Ford |first2=W.

[[Image:Milgrom Mordechai.jpg|thumb|upright|MOND was proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983]]

The basic premise of MOND is that while Newton's laws have been extensively tested in high-acceleration environments (in the Solar System and on Earth), they have not been verified for objects with extremely low acceleration, such as stars in the outer parts of galaxies. This led Milgrom to postulate a new effective gravitational force law (sometimes referred to as "'''Milgrom's law'''") that relates the true acceleration of an object to the acceleration that would be predicted for it on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.<ref name="Milgrom papers"/> This law, the keystone of MOND, is chosen to reproduce the Newtonian result at high acceleration but leads to different ("deep-MOND") behavior at low acceleration:

{{NumBlk|::|<math> F_\text{N} = m \, \mu\left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right)\, a ~. </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here {{mvar|F}}{{sub|N}} is the Newtonian force, {{mvar|m}} is the object's (gravitational) [[mass]], {{mvar|a}} is its acceleration, {{mvar|μ}}({{mvar|x}}) is an as-yet unspecified function (called the ''interpolating function''), and {{mvar|a}}{{sub|0}} is a new fundamental constant which marks the transition between the Newtonian and deep-MOND regimes. Agreement with Newtonian mechanics requires

:<math>\begin{align} \mu(x) \longrightarrow 1 && \text{ for } x \gg 1 \end{align} ~,</math>

and consistency with astronomical observations requires

:<math>\begin{align} \mu(x) \longrightarrow x && \text{ for } x \ll 1 \end{align} ~.</math>

Beyond these limits, the interpolating function is not specified by the hypothesis, although it is possible to weakly constrain it empirically.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Gentile |first2=B. |last2=Famaey |first3=W.J.G. |last3=de&nbsp;Blok |year=2011 |title=THINGS about MOND |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=527 |issue=A76 |pages=A76 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201015283 |arxiv=1011.4148|bibcode=2011A&A...527A..76G |s2cid=73653467 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=B. |last1=Famaey |first2=J. |last2=Binney |year=2005 |title=Modified Newtonian dynamics in the Milky Way |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=363 |issue=2 |pages=603–608 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09474.x |arxiv=astro-ph/0506723|bibcode=2005MNRAS.363..603F |s2cid=150557 }}</ref> Two common choices are the "simple interpolating function":

:<math>\mu\left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{a_0}{a}} ~,</math>

and the "standard interpolating function":

:<math>\mu\left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{a_0}{a} \right)^2}~} ~.</math>

Thus, in the deep-MOND regime ({{mvar|a}} ≪ {{mvar|a}}{{sub|0}}):

:<math> F_\text{N} = m \frac{\, a^2 \,}{\, a_0 \,} ~.</math>

Applying this to a star or other object of mass {{mvar|m}} in [[circular orbit]] around mass {{mvar|M}} (the total baryonic mass of the galaxy), produces

{{NumBlk|::|<math>\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \frac{\left( \frac{v^2}{r} \right)^2}{a_0} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad v^4 = G M a_0 ~</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

By fitting his law to rotation curve data, Milgrom found {{nobreak|''a''<sub>0</sub> ≈ 1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>}} to be optimal.

MOND holds that for accelerations smaller than an ''a''<sub>0</sub> value of roughly {{nobreak|1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>,}} accelerations increasingly depart from the standard {{nobreak|''M&thinsp;·&thinsp;G''&thinsp;/&thinsp;''r''&thinsp;<sup>2</sup>}} Newtonian relationship of mass and distance, wherein gravitational strength is proportional to mass and the inverse square of distance. Specifically, the theory holds that when gravity is well below the ''a''<sub>0</sub> value, its ''rate of change''—including the curvature of [[spacetime]]—increases with the ''square root of mass'' (rather than linearly as per Newtonian law) and decreases ''linearly with distance'' (rather than distance squared).

Whenever a small mass, ''m'' is near a much larger mass, ''M'', whether it be a star near the center of a galaxy or an object near or on Earth, MOND yields dynamics that are indistinguishably close to those of Newtonian gravity. This 1-to-1 correspondence between MOND and Newtonian dynamics is retained down to accelerations of about {{nobreak|1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>}} (the ''a''<sub>0</sub> value); as accelerations decline below ''a''<sub>0</sub>, MOND's dynamics rapidly diverge from the Newtonian description of gravity. For instance, there is a certain distance from the center of any given galaxy at which its gravitational acceleration equals ''a''<sub>0</sub>; at ten times that distance, Newtonian gravity predicts a hundredfold decline in gravity whereas MOND predicts only a tenfold reduction.

It is important to note that the Newtonian component of MOND's dynamics remains active at accelerations well below the ''a''<sub>0</sub> value of {{nobreak|1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>}}; the equations of MOND assert no minimum acceleration for the Newtonian component. However, because the residual Newtonian-like dynamics of MOND continue to decline as the inverse square of distance below ''a''<sub>0</sub>—just as they do above—they ''comparatively'' vanish as they become overwhelmed by the stronger “deep-MOND” linear dynamics of the theory.

MOND predicts stellar velocities that closely match observations for an extraordinarily wide range of distances from galactic centers of mass. The {{nobreak|1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>}} magnitude of ''a''<sub>0</sub> establishes not only the distance from the center of the galaxy at which Newtonian and MOND dynamics diverge, but ''a''<sub>0</sub> also establishes the angle (when not plotted with [[Log–log plot|log/log scales]]) of the non-Newtonian linear slope on ''velocity/radius'' graphs like ''Fig.&nbsp;1''. 

MOND-compliant gravity, which explains galactic-scale observations, was not previously detected closer to Earth, such as in national laboratories or the trajectories of interplanetary spacecraft, because the ''a''<sub>0</sub> acceleration, {{nobreak|1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>}}, at which the dynamics of MOND begin diverging from Newtonian dynamics, is—as a practical matter—indistinguishably close to perfect [[weightlessness]]. Within the Solar System, the ''v''<sup>&thinsp;4</sup>&thinsp;=&thinsp;''GMa''<sub>0</sub> equation makes the effect of the ''a''<sub>0</sub> term virtually nonexistent; it is overwhelmed by the enormous—and highly Newtonian—gravitational influence of the Sun as well as the variability of Earth's surface gravity. 

On Earth's surface—and in national laboratories when performing ultra-precise gravimetry—the ''a''<sub>0</sub> value is equal to 0.012&nbsp;[[Gal (unit)|microgal]] (μGal), which is only twelve-trillionths the strength of [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]. A change in the laws of gravity below this acceleration is far too small to be resolved with even the most sensitive free-fall-style absolute [[Gravimetry|gravimeters]] available to national labs, like the FG5-X, which is accurate to just ±2&nbsp;μGal. When considering why MOND's effects aren't detectible with precision gravimetry on Earth, it is important to remember that ''a''<sub>0</sub> doesn't represent a spurious force; it is the gravitational strength at which MOND is theorized to significantly begin departing from the Newtonian dynamic. Moreover, the ''a''<sub>0</sub> ''strength'' is equivalent to the ''change'' in Earth's gravity brought about by an elevation difference of 0.04&nbsp;mm—the width of a fine human hair. Such subtle gravitational details, besides being unresolvable with current gravimeters, are overwhelmed by [[Earth tide|twice-daily distortions in Earth's shape]] due to lunar gravitational tides, which can cause local elevation changes nearly 10,000 times greater than 0.04&nbsp;mm. Such disturbances in local gravity due to tidal distortions are even detectable as variations in the [[Clock rate|rate]] of a [[Shortt–Synchronome clock|Shortt double-pendulum clock]], which was a national timekeeping standard in the late 1920s.

Even at the edge of the Solar System, the ''a''<sub>0</sub> point at which MOND dynamics significantly diverge from Newtonian dynamics is overwhelmed and masked by the much stronger gravitational fields from the Sun and planets, which follow Newtonian gravity. To give a sense of scale to ''a''<sub>0</sub>, a free-floating mass in space that was exposed for one hour to {{nobreak|1.2&thinsp;×&thinsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>}} would "fall" by just 0.8 millimeter—roughly the thickness of a credit card. An interplanetary spacecraft on a free-flying inertial path well above the Solar System's [[ecliptic plane]] (where it is isolated from the gravitational influence of individual planets) would, when at the same distance from the Sun as Neptune, experience a classic Newtonian gravitational strength that is 55,000 times stronger than ''a''<sub>0</sub>. For small Solar System asteroids, gravitational effects in the realm of ''a''<sub>0</sub> are comparable in magnitude to the [[Yarkovsky effect]], which subtly perturbs their orbits over long periods due to momentum transfer from the non-symmetric emission of thermal photons. The Sun's contribution to interstellar galactic gravity doesn't decline to the ''a''<sub>0</sub> threshold at which MOND's effects predominate until objects are 41&nbsp;[[Light-second#Use_in_astronomy|light-days]] from the Sun; this is 53 times further away from the Sun than [[Voyager 2]] was in November 2022, which has been in the [[interstellar medium]] since 2012.

Despite its vanishingly small and undetectable effects on bodies that are on Earth, within the Solar System, and even in proximity to the Solar System and other [[planetary system]]s, MOND successfully explains significant observed galactic-scale rotational effects without invoking the existence of as-yet undetected dark matter particles lying outside of the highly successful [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. This is in large part due to MOND holding that exceedingly weak galactic-scale gravity holding galaxies together near their perimeters declines as a very slow linear relationship to distance from the center of a galaxy rather than declining as the inverse square of distance.

Milgrom's law can be interpreted in two ways:
* One possibility is to treat it as a modification to [[Newton's second law]], so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration {{mvar|a}} but rather to <math display=inline>\mu\left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) a.</math> In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other [[forces]], for example [[electromagnetism]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Milgrom |title=MOND – Particularly as modified inertia |journal=Acta Physica Polonica B |year=2011 |volume=42 |issue=11 |page=2175 |doi=10.5506/APhysPolB.42.2175 |arxiv=1111.1611|s2cid=119272458 }}</ref>
* Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving [[Newton's Second Law]] intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass {{mvar|m}} due to another of mass {{mvar|M}} is roughly of the form <math display=inline>\frac{G M m}{\mu\left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) r^2}.</math> In this interpretation, Milgrom's modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena.

By itself, Milgrom's law is not a complete and self-contained [[physical theory]], but rather an ad hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several equations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent non-relativistic hypothesis of MOND is akin to [[Kepler's Third Law]] within Newtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational facts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated within the underlying hypothesis. Several complete classical hypotheses have been proposed (typically along "modified gravity" as opposed to "modified inertia" lines), which generally yield Milgrom's law exactly in situations of high [[symmetry]] and otherwise deviate from it slightly. A subset of these non-relativistic hypotheses have been further embedded within relativistic theories, which are capable of making contact with non-classical phenomena (e.g., [[gravitational lensing]]) and [[cosmology]].<ref name="famaey mcgaugh">{{cite journal |first1=B. |last1=Famaey |first2=S. |last2=McGaugh |title=Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND): Observational phenomenology and relativistic extensions |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |year=2012 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=10 |doi=10.12942/lrr-2012-10 |pmid=28163623 |pmc=5255531 |arxiv=1112.3960|bibcode=2012LRR....15...10F }}</ref> Distinguishing both theoretically and observationally between these alternatives is a subject of current research.

The majority of [[astronomers]], [[astrophysicists]], and [[cosmologists]] accept dark matter as the explanation for galactic rotation curves (based on general relativity, and hence Newtonian mechanics), and are committed to a dark matter solution of the missing-mass problem.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bertone|first1=Gianfranco|last2=Hooper|first2=Dan|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|title=History of dark matter|year=2018|volume=90|issue=4|publisher=American Physical Society|pages=045002|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.90.045002|arxiv=1605.04909 |bibcode=2018RvMP...90d5002B |s2cid=18596513 }}</ref> The primary difference between supporters of [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]] and MOND is in the observations for which they demand a robust, quantitative explanation, and those for which they are satisfied with a qualitative account, or are prepared to leave for future work.

== Observational evidence for MOND ==

Since MOND was specifically designed to produce flat rotation curves, these do not constitute evidence for the hypothesis, but every matching observation adds to support of the empirical law. Nevertheless, proponents claim that a broad range of astrophysical phenomena at the galactic scale are neatly accounted for within the MOND framework.<ref name="famaey mcgaugh"/><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1212.2568|doi = 10.1093/mnras/stt2066|title = MOND laws of galactic dynamics|year = 2014|last1 = Milgrom|first1 = Mordehai|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume = 437|issue = 3|pages = 2531–2541|bibcode = 2014MNRAS.437.2531M|s2cid = 118840212}}</ref> Many of these came to light after the publication of Milgrom's original papers and are difficult to explain using the dark matter hypothesis. The most prominent are the following:

* In addition to demonstrating that rotation curves in MOND are flat, equation 2 provides a concrete relation between a galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas) and its asymptotic rotation velocity. This predicted relation was called by Milgrom the [[mass-asymptotic speed relation]] (MASSR); its observational manifestation is known as the baryonic [[Tully–Fisher relation]] (BTFR),<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = astro-ph/0003001|doi = 10.1086/312628|title = The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation|year = 2000|last1 = McGaugh|first1 = S.

* Milgrom's law fully specifies the rotation curve of a galaxy given only the distribution of its baryonic mass. In particular, MOND predicts a far stronger correlation between features in the baryonic mass distribution and features in the rotation curve than does the dark matter hypothesis (since dark matter dominates the galaxy's mass budget and is conventionally assumed not to closely track the distribution of baryons). Such a tight correlation is claimed to be observed in several spiral galaxies, a fact which has been referred to as "Renzo's rule".<ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/>
* Since MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics in an acceleration-dependent way, it predicts a specific relationship between the acceleration of a star at any radius from the centre of a galaxy and the amount of unseen (dark matter) mass within that radius that would be inferred in a Newtonian analysis. This is known as the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation, and has been measured observationally.<ref>R.

In a dark matter hypothesis, it is a challenge to understand why this mass should correlate so closely with acceleration, and why there appears to be a critical acceleration above which dark matter is not required.<ref name = "tale of two paradigms"/>

* Particularly massive galaxies are within the Newtonian regime (''a'' > ''a''<sub>0</sub>) out to radii enclosing the vast majority of their baryonic mass. At these radii, MOND predicts that the rotation curve should fall as 1/''r'', in accordance with [[Kepler's Laws]].

== Complete MOND hypotheses ==

Milgrom's law requires incorporation into a complete hypothesis if it is to satisfy [[conservation laws]] and provide a unique solution for the time evolution of any physical system. Each of the theories described here reduce to Milgrom's law in situations of high symmetry (and thus enjoy the successes described above), but produce different behavior in detail.

=== Nonrelativistic ===

The first hypothesis of MOND (dubbed [[AQUAL]]) was constructed in 1984 by Milgrom and [[Jacob Bekenstein]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jacob Bekenstein |author2=M. Milgrom |name-list-style=amp |title=Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian gravity?|journal=Astrophys. J.|volume=286|pages=7–14|date=1984|bibcode = 1984ApJ...286....7B |doi = 10.1086/162570 }}</ref> AQUAL generates MONDian behavior by modifying the gravitational term in the classical [[lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from being quadratic in the gradient of the Newtonian potential to a more general function. (AQUAL is an acronym for A QUAdratic Lagrangian.) In formulae:

:<math>\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\text{Newton} &= - \frac{1}{8 \pi G} \cdot \|\nabla \phi\|^2 \\ [6pt]
\mathcal{L}_\text{AQUAL}  &= - \frac{1}{8 \pi G} \cdot a_0^2 F \left (\tfrac{\|\nabla \phi\|^2}{a_0^2} \right )
\end{align}</math>

where  <math>\phi</math> is the standard Newtonian gravitational potential and ''F'' is a new dimensionless function. Applying the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in the standard way then leads to a non-linear generalization of the [[Poisson's equation|Newton–Poisson equation]]:

:<math> \nabla\cdot\left[ \mu \left( \frac{\left\| \nabla\phi \right\|}{a_0} \right) \nabla\phi\right] = 4\pi G \rho </math>

This can be solved given suitable boundary conditions and choice of F to yield Milgrom's law (up to a [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] field correction which vanishes in situations of high symmetry).

An alternative way to modify the gravitational term in the lagrangian is to introduce a distinction between the true (MONDian) acceleration field '''a''' and the Newtonian acceleration field '''a<sub>N</sub>'''. The Lagrangian may be constructed so that '''a<sub>N</sub>''' satisfies the usual Newton-Poisson equation, and is then used to find '''a''' via an additional algebraic but non-linear step, which is chosen to satisfy Milgrom's law. This is called the "quasi-linear formulation of MOND", or QUMOND,<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = 0911.5464|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.16184.x|title = Quasi-linear formulation of MOND|year = 2010|last1 = Milgrom|first1 = Mordehai|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume = 403|issue = 2|pages = 886–895|bibcode = 2010MNRAS.403..886M|s2cid = 119305157}}</ref> and is particularly useful for calculating the distribution of "phantom" dark matter that would be inferred from a Newtonian analysis of a given physical situation.<ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/>

Both AQUAL and QUMOND propose changes to the gravitational part of the classical matter action, and hence interpret Milgrom's law as a modification of Newtonian gravity as opposed to Newton's second law. The alternative is to turn the kinetic term of the action into a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] depending on the trajectory of the particle. Such "modified inertia" theories, however, are difficult to use because they are time-nonlocal, require [[energy]] and [[momentum]] to be non-trivially redefined to be conserved, and have predictions that depend on the entirety of a particle's orbit.<ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/>

=== Relativistic ===

== The external field effect ==

In Newtonian mechanics, an object's acceleration can be found as the vector sum of the acceleration due to each of the individual forces acting on it. This means that a [[subsystem]] can be decoupled from the larger system in which it is embedded simply by referring the motion of its constituent particles to their centre of mass; in other words, the influence of the larger system is irrelevant for the internal dynamics of the subsystem. Since Milgrom's law is [[non-linear]] in acceleration, MONDian subsystems cannot be decoupled from their environment in this way, and in certain situations this leads to behaviour with no Newtonian parallel. This is known as the "external field effect" (EFE),<ref name = "Milgrom papers"/> for which there exists observational evidence.<ref name = "Chae EFE"/>

The external field effect is best described by classifying physical systems according to their relative values of ''a''<sub>in</sub> (the characteristic acceleration of one object within a subsystem due to the influence of another), ''a''<sub>ex</sub> (the acceleration of the entire subsystem due to forces exerted by objects outside of it), and ''a''<sub>0</sub>:

* <math> a_{\mathrm{in}} > a_0 </math> :  Newtonian regime
* <math> a_{\mathrm{ex}} < a_{\mathrm{in}} < a_0 </math> :  Deep-MOND regime
* <math> a_{\mathrm{in}} < a_0 < a_{\mathrm{ex}} </math> : The external field is dominant and the behavior of the system is Newtonian.
* <math> a_{\mathrm{in}} < a_{\mathrm{ex}} < a_0 </math> : The external field is larger than the internal acceleration of the system, but both are smaller than the critical value. In this case, dynamics is Newtonian but the effective value of ''G'' is enhanced by a factor of ''a''<sub>0</sub>/''a''<sub>ex</sub>.<ref>S. McGaugh, [http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/EFE.html The EFE in MOND] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716235250/http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/EFE.html |date=2017-07-16 }}</ref>

The external field effect implies a fundamental break with the [[strong equivalence principle]] (but not necessarily the [[weak equivalence principle]]). The effect was postulated by Milgrom in the first of his 1983 papers to explain why some [[open clusters]] were observed to have no mass discrepancy even though their internal accelerations were below a<sub>0</sub>. It has since come to be recognized as a crucial element of the MOND paradigm.

The dependence in MOND of the internal dynamics of a system on its external environment (in principle, the rest of the [[universe]]) is strongly reminiscent of [[Mach's principle]], and may hint towards a more fundamental structure underlying Milgrom's law. In this regard, Milgrom has commented:<ref>{{Cite arXiv|eprint = 0801.3133|last1 = Milgrom|first1 = Mordehai|title = The MOND paradigm|year = 2008|class = astro-ph}}</ref>

<blockquote>It has been long suspected that local dynamics is strongly influenced by the universe at large, ''a-la'' Mach's principle, but MOND seems to be the first to supply concrete evidence for such a connection. This may turn out to be the most fundamental implication of MOND, beyond its implied modification of Newtonian dynamics and general relativity, and beyond the elimination of dark matter.</blockquote>

Indeed, the potential link between MONDian dynamics and the universe as a whole (that is, cosmology) is augmented by the observation that the value of ''a''<sub>0</sub> (determined by fits to internal properties of galaxies) is within an order of magnitude of ''cH''<sub>0</sub>, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''H''<sub>0</sub> is the [[Hubble constant]] (a measure of the present-day expansion rate of the universe).<ref name = "Milgrom papers"/> It is also close to the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration rate of the universe]], and hence the [[cosmological constant]]. Recent work on a transactional formulation of [[Entropic gravity]] by Schlatter and Kastner <ref>{{cite journal | url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/acd6d7 | doi=10.1088/2399-6528/acd6d7 | title=Gravity from transactions: Fulfilling the entropic gravity program | date=2023 | last1=Schlatter | first1=A. | last2=Kastner | first2=R. E. | journal=Journal of Physics Communications | volume=7 | issue=6 | page=065009 | s2cid=258791517 }}</ref> suggests a natural connection between ''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''H''<sub>0</sub>, and the [[cosmological constant]].

== Responses and criticism ==

=== Dark matter explanation ===

While acknowledging that Milgrom's law provides a succinct and accurate description of a range of galactic phenomena, many physicists reject the idea that classical dynamics itself needs to be modified and attempt instead to explain the law's success by reference to the behavior of dark matter. Some effort has gone towards establishing the presence of a characteristic acceleration scale as a natural consequence of the behavior of cold dark matter halos,<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = astro-ph/0107284|doi = 10.1086/340578|title = How Cold Dark Matter Theory Explains Milgrom's Law|year = 2002|last1 = Kaplinghat|first1 = Manoj|last2 = Turner|first2 = Michael|journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume = 569|issue = 1|pages = L19–L22|bibcode = 2002ApJ...569L..19K|s2cid = 5679705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1310.6810|doi = 10.1093/mnras/stt2062|title = Using the topology of large-scale structure in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey as a cosmological standard ruler|year = 2014|last1 = Blake|first1 = Chris|last2 = James|first2 = J.

=== Outstanding problems for MOND ===

The most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a residual mass discrepancy even when analyzed using MOND.<ref name = "tale of two paradigms"/> The fact that some form of unseen mass must exist in these systems detracts from the adequacy of MOND as a solution to the missing mass problem, although the amount of extra mass required is a fifth that of a Newtonian analysis, and there is no requirement that the missing mass be non-baryonic.

Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the clusters using [[visible light|visible]] and [[X-ray]] light, respectively, and in addition mapped the inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one would expect the "missing mass" to be centred on regions of visible mass which experience accelerations lower than a<sub>0</sub> (assuming the external field effect is negligible). In ΛCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to be significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two colliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is conventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would interact and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the observations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be able to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically symmetric systems, such as the Bullet Cluster.<ref>{{cite journal| author=G.W.

This is the case for the more commonly used modified gravity versions of MOND, but some formulations (most prominently those based on modified inertia) have long suffered from poor compatibility with cherished physical principles such as conservation laws. Researchers working on MOND generally do not interpret it as a modification of inertia, with only very limited work done on this area.

== Proposals for testing MOND ==

Several observational and experimental tests have been proposed to help distinguish<ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=0705.3408|title=Testing Gravity in the Outer Solar System: Results from Trans-Neptunian Objects|author=Wallin, John F.|author2=Dixon, David S.|author3=Page, Gary L.|date=23 May 2007|doi=10.1086/520528|volume=666|issue=2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|pages=1296–1302|bibcode=2007ApJ...666.1296W|s2cid=18654075}}</ref> between MOND and dark matter-based models:

* The [[Dark matter#Detection of dark matter particles|detection]] of particles suitable for constituting cosmological dark matter would strongly suggest that ΛCDM is correct and no modification to Newton's laws is required.
* If MOND is taken as a theory of modified inertia, it predicts the existence of anomalous accelerations on the Earth at particular places and times of the year. These could be detected in a precision experiment. This prediction would not hold if MOND is taken as a theory of modified gravity, as the external field effect produced by the Earth would cancel MONDian effects at the Earth's surface.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1408.3059|doi = 10.1139/cjp-2014-0164|title = Testing MOND on Earth|year = 2015|last1 = Ignatiev|first1 = A.Yu.|journal = Canadian Journal of Physics|volume = 93|issue = 2|pages = 166–168|bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..166I| s2cid=119260352 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv = 1002.2766|doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811520|title = Testing the Newton second law in the regime of small accelerations|year = 2009|last1 = De Lorenci|first1 = V.
